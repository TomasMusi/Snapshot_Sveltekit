# Snapshot_Sveltekit

The goal of this page was to learn the Snapshot Library. I found out that Snapshot Library works on the basis of history, so if we go to a "new page" it will load a new history and if we go back not by arrows, but for example by navigation, the data will not be saved. If we want to save the data we have to go back in the history according to the arrows and Snapshot will return the data from the Session storage array.
